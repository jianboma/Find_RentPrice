# Find_RentPrice

This is a my own MySQL practice folder.

obtain_data.py (This script is copied from https://blog.csdn.net/Oscer2016/article/details/70257956) is a helloworld script for obtaining data from website.

Suppose you have fetched data from somewhere and stored. MySQL can be interacted by pymysql in python.

process_rentprice.py is a demo code for selecting data from a MySQL database and using a gaussian to fit the data.
